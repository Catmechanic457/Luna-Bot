A discord bot programed by discord user catm_457

CONFIGURING :
In order to function, the bot must have a TOKEN defined in a file at "data/config.txt" (can be configured in the source code if you know basic python)
The token must be defined in the file as :

`
<token>
XXX.XXX
`
Replacing "XXX.XXX" with the token of the bot

Every configuration option can be found in config_examples.txt
